Algorithm Complexity:
TIME COMPLEXITY
1.Time taken by program to execute is never called Time complexity
2.Time complexity is a function that gives us relationship about the time as size of input grows. 
3.Time always varies from machine to machine 
4.Always look for worst case complexity.
5.We always care about large size of data(input). 
6.Lets analyise by graphs: f(t) = c,f(t) = t ,f(t)
